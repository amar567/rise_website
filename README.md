# Github Repo

## Old Website

It is a backup version created by downloading old website page by page. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/amar567/rise_website/tree/main/OLD).

## New Attempt

Keeping in mind the need for ease of maintainnance and Need to avoid reuploading and editing data on every design, I decided to use a Database instead of wordpress.

I used NocoDB (a FOSS project) as DB which has some parts publicly viewable, that can be fetched using API Calls to nocodb server (Currently free) [we can also spin up an local instance of the same on our server]

Please excuse the lack of documentation for the newer atempt, but code is relatively simple. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/amar567/rise_website/tree/main/NEW/newNew)
